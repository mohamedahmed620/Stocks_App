            <p class="p-3 mb-2 bg-secondary text-white">The price-to-earnings ratio is the ratio for valuing a company that measures its current share price relative to its earnings per share (EPS).</p>
            <h3>EPS</h3>
            <p class="p-3 mb-2 bg-secondary text-white">Earnings per share (EPS) is calculated as a company's profit divided by the outstanding shares of its common stock. The resulting number serves as an indicator of a company's profitability.</p>
            <h3>Volume</h3>
            <p class="p-3 mb-2 bg-secondary text-white">Volume is simply the number of shares traded in a particular stock, index, or other investment over a specific period of time.</p>

            <p class="p-3 mb-2 bg-secondary text-white">The dividend yield is a financial ratio that tells you the percentage of a company's share price that it pays out in dividends each year. For example, if a company has a $20 share price and pays a dividend of $1 per year, its dividend yield would be 5%.</p>
            <h3>Revenue Per Share</h3>
            <p class="p-3 mb-2 bg-secondary text-white">Sales per share is a ratio that computes the total revenue earned per share over a designated period, whether quarterly, semi-annually, annually, or trailing twelve months (TTM). It is calculated by dividing total revenue by average total shares outstanding.</p>
